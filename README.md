  Inspired by KennyJam 2024, Linky is a two player shared-screen game.
  The players are linked by Linky, a laser beam which must not be broken or interrupt.

## Feature

- ‚ú® Two players - Shared screen
- üìù Multiple rooms to resolve!
- üéÅ Infinite run


## Roadmap

- No more roadmap


## Contribute

If you want to create your own rooms, you can fork the project.
Look at how other rooms are created: `/scenes/levels/door/...` for instance.
Once created, you may add it to `InfiniteLoader` class.

Basically, a room should:
- extend `BasicLevel`
- start at [0; 0] and face the top
- have a Node2D defining the position to place the next level
- have 6 blocks wide start and end
- be finishable
